# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management process documentation. This folder contains comprehensive guidance for running projects across OctoAcme, from initiation through retrospectives.

## Quick Start

New to OctoAcme projects? Start here:
1. Read **[Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** for the big picture
2. Follow **[Project Initiation Guide](octoacme-project-initiation.md)** when starting a new initiative
3. Use **[Project Planning](octoacme-project-planning.md)** to structure your work
4. Reference **[Execution & Tracking](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)** during delivery
5. Learn **[Release & Deployment](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)** practices before shipping
6. Apply **[Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)** throughout
7. Run **[Retrospectives](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)** to improve continuously
8. Understand **[Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** to see who does what

## OctoAcme Project Management Overview

### Lifecycle and Iterative Delivery

OctoAcme follows a structured, five-phase project lifecycle designed to deliver customer value through iterative, measurable outcomes. The process begins with **Initiation**, where new ideas are validated through a lightweight Project One-pager that confirms business need, identifies stakeholders, and establishes success metrics. Once approved by leadership, projects move into **Planning**, where work is broken into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria, dependencies are mapped, and a release plan is created. The **Execution** phase emphasizes daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and continuous quality assurance through automated testing and manual QA. Projects then proceed to **Release**, where staged deployments, smoke testing, and rollback plans ensure safe production delivery. Finally, **Retrospectives** capture learnings and drive continuous improvement through tracked action items.

### Core Roles and Communication

OctoAcme defines clear ownership across four primary personas: **Project Managers** coordinate schedules, risks, and communications to keep projects on track; **Product Managers** define customer value and prioritize the backlog based on success metrics; **Developers** implement features collaboratively and maintain high code quality; and **QA/Testing** validates acceptance criteria and product usability. Communication follows a structured cadence: daily 15-minute standups focus on progress and blockers, weekly syncs between PM and Product Lead align on risks and dependencies, and monthly stakeholder updates provide transparency. A three-level escalation path (team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor) ensures blockers are resolved efficiently without creating silos.

### Quality Assurance and Risk Management

Quality is embedded throughout execution via a multi-layered testing strategy: unit tests for new logic, integration tests where applicable, end-to-end smoke tests before release, and security scanning in CI pipelines. Each project maintains a **Risk Register** tracking impact, likelihood, ownership, and mitigation plans, with risks reviewed and updated weekly. The team uses GitHub Projects for workflow visibility, with columns for Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done, ensuring work is transparent and dependencies are flagged early.

### Key Artifacts and Continuous Improvement

OctoAcme centralizes project knowledge in living artifacts: the Project Charter/One-pager, Release Plan, Sprint Backlog, Risk Register, and Retrospective notes. Process documentation itself is version-controlled in the `docs/` folder and can be extended via GitHub issue templates, enabling the team to refine processes collaboratively. This approach reduces onboarding friction, minimizes single-person dependency, and ensures that process improvements validated through retrospectives feed back into standardized team practices.
